PacMen
======
### PacMen Exercise:

**Description:** In this exercise we go a bit retro and give PacMan a new lease in life and also get our hands into a bit of cloning so that he/it doesn't feel alone while strolling within the borders of your browser window.

**Usage:** Download the code repository to you computer and load the file in your web browser. Press the `Add PacMan` button to add PacMan to the window in your browser and then press `Start Game`, then sit back and relax while the PacMan or PacMen move around your browser.

**Roadmap:** Thinking off adding more charactetrs like Sticth and Doraemon...
